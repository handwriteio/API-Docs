### Merge Variables

Sometimes you'll want to send a card to many people with slightly different text on each one. For example, you might want to address each recipient by his or her first name.

In order to do this, you'll use "merge variables."

`Hey {firstName}, I hope all is well down in {city}! How's business at {company} these days?`

In this case, each occurrence of {firstName} will be replaced with the recipient's actual first name.

We support the following merge variables currently, with more coming in the future including custom merge variables:

- first name: `{firstName}`
- last name: `{lastName}`
- company: `{company}`
- city: `{city}`
- state: `{state}`
